      "Gravity was not exactly \"discovered.\" Instead, the concept of gravity has been understood and described by various scientists throughout history. Here are some key figures who contributed to our understanding of gravity:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727): Newton is often credited with developing the law of universal gravitation, which states that every point mass attracts every other point mass by a force acting along the line intersecting both points. He published his groundbreaking work \"Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica\" in 1687.\n",
      "2. Galileo Galilei (1564-1642): Galileo made significant contributions to our understanding of gravity during his experiments with falling bodies and the behavior of celestial objects. He observed that objects fall at the same rate in all gravitational fields, which challenged Newton's theory of universal gravitation.\n",
      "3. Johannes Kepler (1571-1630): Kepler discovered the law of elliptical orbits, which describes how planets orbit around the sun. This work laid the foundation for our understanding of the gravitational forces that govern planetary motion.\n",
      "4. Albert Einstein (1879-1955): Einstein's theory of general relativity revolutionized our understanding of gravity. He introduced the concept of spacetime and showed that gravity is not a force, but rather the curvature of spacetime caused by massive objects.\n",
      "\n",
      "While these scientists made significant contributions to our understanding of gravity, it's essential to note that the concept of gravity has been described and studied by many other scientists throughout history, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Epicurus (341-270 BCE): Proposed the idea that all objects attract each other with an invisible force.\n",
      "* Aristotle (384-322 BCE): Described the attractive force between objects as a result of their motion.\n",
      "* Democritus (460-370 BCE): Proposed the idea that objects move in circular orbits due to the attractive force.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Classical Computers**\n",
      "\n",
      "Think of a classical computer like a really smart but very slow calculator. It works by using numbers and logic gates to perform calculations. Each gate can either be true (1) or false (0), and it takes time to figure out what the answer is.\n",

      "\n",
      "Imagine you have a lot of calculators, each one with its own set of numbers to calculate. A classical computer would need to switch between all those calculators (each one working on the current number) to get the right answer. But a quantum computer can do it all in parallel, like having many calculators that work simultaneously.\n",

      "2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, transforming, and preparing the data for analysis.\n",
      "3. **Model Selection**: Choosing an algorithm (a set of instructions) to use for learning from the data.\n",
      "4. **Training**: The algorithm is fed the training data, and it starts to learn patterns and relationships between variables.\n",
      "5. **Validation**: Testing the model on a separate dataset to evaluate its performance and accuracy.\n",
